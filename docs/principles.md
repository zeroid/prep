#Design Principles

1. Code to contracts not implementations

2. Single Responsibility Principle - A component should have one reason and one reason only to change.

3. Tell Don't Ask - Tell an object to do something with the data it owns.

4. Highlander Principle - There can be only one (method overloading)
    * The one with the most wins
      * The one with the most specific wins

5. OCP (Open Closed Principle) - A component should be open for extension and closed for modification.

6. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

7. Favour composition over inheritance
